Welcome to benchmark-hpc-containers's documentation!
====================================================

This documentation describes the process of installing, configuring, 
and optimising HPL and STREAM benchmarks on your system, whether it is
your laptop, or a much more powerful High Performace Computer.
The documentation is divided into sections for :ref:`Baremetal<Baremetal>`, :ref:`Docker<Docker>` and :ref:`Singularity<Singularity>` installations.
There are also sections on how to configure the benchmarks for best results (:ref:`HPL-optimisation` and :ref:`STREAM-optimisation`).
